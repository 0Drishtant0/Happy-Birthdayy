## How to setup
Setup is very simple. Just edit the configuration object in [animation.js](./js/animation.js). This is what the configuration object looks like. 

```js
const config = {
    name: "Aditi", // actual name of the recipient (Mandatory)
    nickname: "Hildul", // nickname(optional)
    pic: "", //image url of recipients (Mandatory)
    showScrollMsg: true, // set to false if you do not want the scrolling message
};

```
